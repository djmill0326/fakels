Don't you hate it when people are in love? They're so
They're so happy so goddamned happy
Don't you hate it when people are in love? They're so
They're so happy   so fucking happy
I want to cut you down
Because it's not fair
That you're so crystal clear
And glassy eyed in love
Dave and Heather   you see them fighting all the time
I kind of like that   I kind of need that
Because I just hate it when people are in love, they're so
They're so happy, so goddamned happy
Don't you hate it?
