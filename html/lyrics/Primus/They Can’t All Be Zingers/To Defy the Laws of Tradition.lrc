What if Christmas didn't come this year?
And no one paid for Christmas cheer?
Who would cry the biggest tear?
The child,
Or the store.
Why do brides wear virgin white?
Most do not reserve that right.
But to choose a color of they're delight.
Would surely bring on the frowns.
To defy the laws of tradition.
It's a crusade only of the brave.
Suppose the tax man,
He comes to town.
And you don't lay your money down.
Yet Mr. Jones,
He killed Mr. Brown
The other day.
Well I wonder.
Who's gonna go to Hell?
