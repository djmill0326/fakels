I felt the earth on Monday
It moved beneath my feet
In the form of a morning paper
Laid out for me to see
Saw his face in a corner picture
I recognized the name
Could not stop staring at the
Face I'd never see again
It's a shame to awake in a world of pain
What does it mean when
A war has taken over?
It's the same every day
I heard my name
What can be saved and
Who will be left to hold her?
The whole world
World over
It's a world wide suicide
The whole world
World over
It's a world wide suicide
Medals on a wooden mantle
Next to a handsome face
That the president took for granted
Writing checks the whole world pays
And in all the madness
Thought becomes numb and naive
Too much to talk about
And nothing for to say
It's the same every day
And the wave won't break
Tell you to pray while
The devil's on his shoulder
Laying claim to the take
That our soldiers save
Does not equate, and
The truth's already out there
The whole world
World over
It's a world wide suicide
The whole world
World over
It's a world wide suicide
Looking in the eyes of the fallen
You've got to know there's another
Another
Another
Another
Another
Way
It's a shame to awake in a world of pain
What does it mean when
The war has taken over
It's the same every day
And the wave won't break
Tell you to pray while
The devil's on his shoulder
The whole world
World over
It's a world wide suicide
The whole world
World over
It's a world wide suicide
The whole world
World over
It's a world wide suicide
The whole world
World over
It's a world wide suicide
