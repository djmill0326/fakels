[00:04.54] Give me a little bit, a little bit
[00:09.83] Just a little bit, or a lot
[00:14.09] Pieces of the dream that I pick up in my mind
[00:18.49] Is not blind, how I fly
[00:24.29] Every day when I look into your brown eyes
[00:28.66] I get high, oh, how high?
[00:34.56] Pieces of the dream that I pick up in my mind
[00:39.03] Is not blind, how I fly
[00:44.84] Every day when I look into your brown eyes
[00:48.94] I get high, I get high
[00:56.22] I, I get high
[01:00.97] Look in your, brown eyes
[01:05.98] I get high
[01:16.30] Higher, higher
[01:21.24] Higher, higher
[01:26.30] Higher, higher
[01:31.67] Higher, you make me higher
[01:37.06] I fly (I fly), I fly (I fly)
[01:41.87] I fly (I fly) I fly
[01:47.27] I fly (take me there), I fly (take me there)
[01:52.43] I fly
[01:55.90]
