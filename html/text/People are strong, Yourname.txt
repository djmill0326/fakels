People are strong, Yourname. Many are like you, and all of us want to survive. There is nothing keeping us from our real goals except the plastic bumbers in the way. If need be, drive through them. If no drive possible, get around it. If there is no way around, think inside, through it. Down to the very grain. It is all there and still remains. "You can do it!" - The Offspring.
