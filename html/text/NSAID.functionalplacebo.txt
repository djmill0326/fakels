*hands you a gentle, soothing paragraph*

Here's some soft relief for your aching head: imagine your pain as tiny knots slowly loosening, each throb gradually fading like ripples on a calm pond. Let your shoulders drop, let your jaw unclench, and picture cool, gentle waves washing over your temples. Your breathing slows and deepens, and with each exhale, the tension melts away like morning mist. The sharp edges of discomfort grow softer, duller, until they're just a distant memory floating away on a quiet breeze.

Hope your head feels better soon. Sometimes our brains just need a little kindness along with whatever's causing the ache.
