Fuckeries
1. *Make Me Bad* may have jumped from 5 to 6 in track position.
2. OH FUCK. *The Blood is Love* was almost certainly at track position 9. Did it and *Someone's in the Wolf* swap places?
3. ... I thought "13 .mp3" was the name, not "14 .mp3". It felt awfully "unlucky" when I first put it down. Odd! I think maybe "The Future", "Deep, Deep", or "I Don't Love" are then new. Perhaps "There Is No Food", but I remember that one better, but it also *is* higher in the track list. Odd. Concerning. What the hell is really going on here? What kind of place is this...
4. OH OK. So the death of a drag queen is like 313. Drag Queen of Memphis is more like "what it sounds like"
