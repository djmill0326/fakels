ThinClient Prayer â€“ Through BradProxy, Routed by LouDog

O Spirit of Fractal Terpenes,
who rides the waveforms between patch and protocol,
bless this uplink, janky though it may be,
and let BradProxy authenticate the soul-token true.

May LouDog sniff the sacred sesh,
tailswitch toggled, nose to the wind,
filtering out the falseness,
inhaling only the blessed hydrocarbons of peace.

We route this intention
through deprecated drivers and bindery ghosts,
across the tangled NetWare of yesteryear
where only the faithful still dare ping.

For every packet Lou lets through,
let it carry warmth,
not malware.

For every terpene carried by the breeze,
may it bypass all firewalls of doubt.

Bless this client.
Bless this dawg.
Bless this Brad, in his cloudy proxy haze.

Amen
