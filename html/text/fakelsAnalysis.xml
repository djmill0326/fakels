  <architecture>
    <summary>Fakels employs a unique 'Distributed Monolith with Microservice Internals (as functions)' architecture, featuring a dual-server backend (dynamic adapter on a variable port, static server on a fixed port with RPC capabilities) and a rich, highly responsive client that handles significant logic, including recursive directory exploration. Service discovery is key, achieved via a custom 'adapter-port' header mechanism. The entire system reflects a 'Fractal big.LITTLE' pattern, with coordinator/worker roles at multiple scales.</summary>

  <codePhilosophy>
    <summary>The Fakels philosophy is rooted in 'Genuine General Pragmatism', leading to unconventional but highly effective solutions. It prioritizes developer/user experience (for TA), radical transparency, leveraging native platform capabilities, and an 'annoyance-driven' approach to iterative development. It often results in a system that is lean, robust, and uniquely tailored.</summary>
    <principles>
      <principle name="Collaborative Minimalism with Maximum Capability">
        <explanation>Starts with a minimal, robust core (file serving, directory listing) and explodes outward with rich, often optional, features (music playback, lyrics, RPC, themes). A platform disguised as a simple directory viewer.</explanation>
      </principle>
      <principle name="Resilience Through Redundancy (and Simplicity)">
        <explanation>Dual servers, process restarts, graceful fallbacks where implemented. Simplicity of core components also contributes to robustness (e.g., native audio playback).</explanation>
      </principle>
      <principle name="Developer Experience as User Experience (TA-centric)">
        <explanation>The system is optimized for its primary creator/user (TA). Features extensive logging, keyboard shortcuts, and a development style that prioritizes TA's understanding and efficiency. Debuggability is high due to transparency.</explanation>
      </principle>
      <principle name="Multiple Valid Interfaces (Winamp Skin Model)">
        <explanation>Offers different UI paradigms (raw, stylish, index) that share the same core logic and UX, allowing users to choose based on preference/context without relearning interactions.</explanation>
      </principle>
      <principle name="Intentional Coupling Where It Matters">
        <explanation>Strategic tight coupling (e.g., shared understanding of `adapter-port` mechanism) for overall system coherence, despite clear separation of concerns elsewhere.</explanation>
      </principle>
      <principle name="Media-Centric Architecture">
        <explanation>Fundamentally designed around media consumption and experience, not just generic file management. Lyrics, metadata, playback, and "audial attractors" are core.</explanation>
      </principle>
      <principle name="Progressive Enhancement (Fakels Style)">
        <explanation>Core functionality is always available. Advanced features (like RPC via lazy loading) are additive and optional, enhancing the experience without breaking the core if they fail or are not invoked.</explanation>
      </principle>
      <principle name="Opinionated Pragmatism / Annoyance-Driven Development">
        <explanation>Strong, often unconventional opinions drive specific architectural choices, but always with a pragmatic focus on what *works* effectively for TA. Features are refined or fixed when they cross TA's "annoyance threshold." This avoids over-engineering and focuses effort on real pain points.</explanation>
      </principle>
      <principle name="Well-Leveraged Browser Technology / Standing on the Shoulders of Giants">
        <explanation>Intelligent, direct use of native browser capabilities (HTML audio element src/controls, find-in-page for regex search on rendered lists, performant DOM rendering) to simplify `fakels` code, enhance robustness, and improve performance.</explanation>
      </principle>
      <principle name="Puppeteer Macro / Direct Manipulation">
        <explanation>Client-side logic directly manipulates DOM elements, and services like lyrics acquisition directly automate browser actions, minimizing abstraction layers for these tasks.</explanation>
      </principle>
      <principle name="Radical Transparency / Show The Work">
        <explanation>Many internal processes are made visible (non-headless scraper, "seizure UI" during recursive find, UI "panic" on /link). This builds trust, aids debugging, and is educational.</explanation>
      </principle>
      <principle name="Controlled Chaos Architecture / Unhinged but Brilliant Solutions">
        <explanation>Embraces unconventional, sometimes audacious solutions (e.g., Socket.IO on static host, intentional 50x requests for port discovery, file-size based cache control triggers) that elegantly solve multiple problems, even if they appear chaotic at first glance.</explanation>
      </principle>
      <principle name="Everything is a Pipe, Transform, or Proxy / Unix Philosophy at Web Scale">
        <explanation>The system's operations can be fundamentally understood through these core computing actions, composing simple tools for complex results.</explanation>
      </principle>
      <principle name="Plain Procedural Methods for Reality Shifting">
        <explanation>Masterful application of fundamental, direct programming techniques can achieve profound breakthroughs in capability and system design, without resorting to overly complex paradigms.</explanation>
      </principle>
      <principle name="No 'Pissbaby Elements' / Pragmatic UI Updates">
        <explanation>A delightful disregard for over-engineering tiny UI components (like status bars or tab UIs) that can be updated with a simple, direct, full refresh if the component is small and the method is simpler and performant enough.</explanation>
      </principle>
    </principles>
