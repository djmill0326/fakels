Topcis:
--------
* Key Lemon Upside Up Down Side-to-Side Shimmy Shimmy Shimbaya Shamalangadaingl(e).
* Posters + Boards.
* Tarp.
* Hemp.
* Chalk. (WATCH OUT. ~)
* Less Sharp Chalk. (LESS WATCHING OUT REQUIRED! GOOD! +)
* Cuts + Blood. Usually -, Bad. Often required, but not usually... (that's a real thinker. it is not required SUPER often. but it MAY happen.)
* Sharp Chalk may cause Cuts or Blood. Watch out because of that. -
* This does not continue, as the context from before does not play with this sentence. (does not cohere.) A dash (`-`) at the end of a coupling (phrase/fragment/word grouping/group/list of items/semantic coupling) tends to indicate a break that may be continued in the next-
(-)[optional]line. This was an example of that principle.
